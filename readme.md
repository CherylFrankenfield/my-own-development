# My Own Development

##### Roadmap of further exploration and continued education

#### By Cheryl Frankenfield, 1/26/18

## Description

_This is an outline of a one-day study in building a guide for how to practice specific skills to become a better and more, well-rounded web developer. This is essentially an action plan for how to tackle and prioritize continued learning._

## Planning

### What? High Priorities for further study

#### 1. API / Database
I'd like to be more proficient with this as it's such an essential skill for any developer.
  *

#### 2. Unit Tests / TDD
I've read/heard how important it is for developers to test their code before going to QA and how this practice may be overlooked quite often. I'd like to learn better practices around how to excel with TDD.
  *
  *

#### 3. Technical Interview Prep
The whiteboarding process and successfully navigating a technical interview is on my practice list for the next couple months.
  *

#### 4. Vanilla JavaScript / Logic
Upon coming to Epicodus, I didn't have any Javascript experience, so continued practice in building apps and doing exercises in JavaScript without jQuery is important to keep up growth. Also, reading more about data structures, algorithms and DRY code is one of my continued goals.
