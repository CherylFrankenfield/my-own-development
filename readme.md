# My Own Development

##### Roadmap of further exploration and continued education

#### By Cheryl Frankenfield, 1/26/18

## Description

_This is an outline of a one-day study in building a guide for how to practice specific skills to become a better and more, well-rounded web developer. This is essentially an action plan for how to tackle and prioritize continued learning._

## Planning

### What? Priorities for further study

#### 1. API / Database
I'd like to be more proficient with this as it's such an essential skill for any developer.
  How?
  --------
  * AWS
  I went to the Epicodus Alumni meetup this month and was inspired by the talk about AWS services for developers. I have added DynamoDB/API Gateway to my list to investigate and possibly use as a host for portfolio projects/personal website.

  * https://newsapi.org/
  I found this API two weeks ago in class and would like to use it to practice making calls and building some type of news-based project, possibly getting a head start this afternoon. With my background in journalism, I am a news geek who is passionate about what I could develop here, plus it'll give me the extra practice at the same time.

#### 2. Unit Tests / TDD / BDD
I've read/heard how important it is for developers to test their code before going to QA and how this practice may be overlooked quite often. I'd like to learn better practices around how to excel with TDD.
  How?
  --------
  * Team Treehouse
  https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-unit-testing
  * https://github.com/mawrkus/js-unit-testing-guide
  * https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tdd-the-rite-way-53c9b46f45e3
  * https://codeburst.io/testing-your-javascript-code-95c171c71647

#### 3. Technical Interview Prep
The whiteboarding process and successfully navigating a technical interview is on my practice list for the next couple months.
  How?
  --------
  * Flash cards
  I have been using a flash card service called Anki, which I highly recommend as it rates knowledge of the card topic and the frequency you need to see cards to solidify knowledge. I have a deck of frequently-asked interview questions that I'll plan to spend some time with today, with the goal of building this into a habit over the next couple months.

  * Whiteboarding
  To help with solidifying concepts, I'm ordering a small whiteboard to practice at home and make this a habit/goal over the next couple of months for job prep.

  * Cracking the Code Interview
  Two developer friends suggested this book so I will look into this today.

#### 4. Vanilla JavaScript / Logic
Upon coming to Epicodus, I didn't have any Javascript experience, so continued practice in building apps and doing exercises in JavaScript without jQuery is important to keep up growth. Also, reading more about data structures, algorithms and DRY code is one of my continued goals.
  How?
  --------
  * Wesbos.com - Javascript 30 in 30 days
  I signed up for this free tutorial site a couple weeks ago and did the first three lessons. Keeping up with this was difficult with learning Angular and APIs this month, but I attempt to do one tutorial and add it to my GitHub this afternoon.

  * CodeNewbie / HackerRank
  I recently discovered these resources this week and will add them to my arsenal for continued learning.
