# My Own Development

### Roadmap of further exploration and continued education

#### By Cheryl Frankenfield, 1/26/18

## Description

_This is an outline of a one-day study in building a guide for how to practice specific skills to become a better and more, well-rounded web developer. This is essentially an action plan for how to tackle and prioritize continued learning._

## Planning

### 1. API / Database

I'd like to be more proficient with this as it's such an essential skill for any developer.

  **AWS** <br>
I went to the Epicodus Alumni meetup this month and was inspired by the talk about AWS services for developers. I have added DynamoDB/API Gateway to my list to investigate and possibly use as a host for portfolio projects/personal website.

  **https://newsapi.org/** <br>
I found this API two weeks ago in class and would like to use it to practice making calls and building some type of news-based project. With my background in journalism, I am a news geek who is passionate about what I could develop here, plus it'll give me the extra practice at the same time.

Please find GitHub repo started here:

### 2. Unit Tests / TDD / BDD

I've read/heard how important it is for developers to test their code before going to QA and how this practice may be overlooked quite often. I'd like to learn better practices around how to excel with TDD.

### 3. Technical Interview Prep

The whiteboarding process and successfully navigating a technical interview is on my practice list for the next couple months.

**Flash cards**<br>
I have been using a flash card service called Anki, which I highly recommend as it rates knowledge of the card topic and the frequency you need to see cards to solidify knowledge. I have a deck of frequently-asked interview questions that I'll plan to spend some time with today, with the goal of building this into a habit over the next couple months.

**Whiteboarding**<br>
To help with solidifying concepts, I'm ordering a small whiteboard to practice at home and make this a habit/goal over the next couple of months for job prep.

**Cracking the Code Interview**<br>
Two developer friends suggested this book so I will look into this today.

### 4. Vanilla JavaScript / Logic

Upon coming to Epicodus, I didn't have any Javascript experience, so continued practice in building apps and doing exercises in JavaScript without jQuery is important to keep up growth. Also, reading more about data structures, algorithms and DRY code is one of my continued goals.

**Wesbos.com - Javascript 30 in 30 days** <br>
I signed up for this free tutorial site a couple weeks ago and did the first three lessons. Keeping up with this was difficult with learning Angular and APIs this month, but I worked on the next one in my queue about JS methods reduce, map, filter and sort. Specifically, today I learned you can console.table() to the DOM and it organizes data much cleaner! It was also great to use ES6 syntax here (I'll be looking up spread operator, which was mentioned) and Array.from().

**CodeNewbie / HackerRank** <br>
I recently discovered these resources this week and will add them to my arsenal for continued learning.

## Further Study Topics

1. Redux
2. ReactNative
3. Vue.js
4. Gatsby.js
5. https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/

## Resources / Newsletters / People to follow on Twitter / Podcasts
1. Dan Abramov, Eric Elliot
2. Podcasts:

* CodeNewbie
* Egghead.io
* The Changelog
* Ruby Rogues podcasts

## Summary
Today was a solid re-centering of where I am as a web developer, where I want to be headed and how to get there. This was a good day to put a roadmap down on paper of priority items to tackle and daily/weekly habits to form. I'm excited to end the day thinking about user stories for a NewsAPI project and how I can integrate what I know into a creative, useful application.
